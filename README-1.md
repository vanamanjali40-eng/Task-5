# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) --- Titanic Dataset

## Project overview

This project explores the Titanic passenger dataset using Python,
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to understand the
dataset, examine missing values and distributions, identify
relationships between passenger characteristics and survival, and
communicate the findings through visualizations.

This is a descriptive exploratory analysis. Relationships found in the
data should not be interpreted as proof of cause and effect.

## Project files

Keep these files together in the same folder:

-   `titanic_dataset.csv` --- source dataset containing 891 passenger
    records and 12 columns.
-   `Task_5_Titanic_EDA.ipynb` --- Jupyter Notebook containing the
    analysis code, charts, observations and conclusion.
-   `README.md` --- project documentation.

## Tools and libraries

-   Python 3
-   Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
-   Pandas
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib
-   Seaborn

## Installation

Install the required packages from a terminal or command prompt:

``` bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## How to run the project

1.  Download or place `titanic_dataset.csv` and
    `Task_5_Titanic_EDA.ipynb` in the same folder.

2.  Open a terminal in that folder.

3.  Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ``` bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4.  Open `Task_5_Titanic_EDA.ipynb`.

5.  Select **Kernel → Restart & Run All** (or **Run All**) to execute
    the analysis.

6.  Review the tables, charts, observations and conclusion produced by
    the notebook.

The notebook reads the CSV using the relative filename
`titanic_dataset.csv`. If the CSV is in a different folder, update the
path in the `pd.read_csv()` statement.

## Dataset description

The dataset has 891 rows and 12 original columns:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Column                              Description
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
  `PassengerId`                       Unique passenger identifier

  `Survived`                          Survival indicator: `0` = did not
                                      survive, `1` = survived

  `Pclass`                            Passenger ticket class: 1, 2 or 3

  `Name`                              Passenger name

  `Sex`                               Passenger sex

  `Age`                               Passenger age

  `SibSp`                             Number of siblings or spouses
                                      aboard

  `Parch`                             Number of parents or children
                                      aboard

  `Ticket`                            Ticket number

  `Fare`                              Passenger fare

  `Cabin`                             Cabin identifier

  `Embarked`                          Port of embarkation
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analysis performed

The notebook carries out the following steps:

1.  **Load and inspect data** --- reads the CSV, displays the dataset
    shape and first rows, and checks data types with `df.info()`.
2.  **Descriptive statistics** --- uses `describe(include="all")` to
    summarize the columns.
3.  **Missing values and duplicates** --- counts missing values and
    duplicate rows.
4.  **Frequency counts** --- examines values in `Survived`, `Pclass`,
    `Sex`, `Embarked`, `SibSp` and `Parch`.
5.  **Prepare analysis column** --- creates `SurvivalStatus` labels for
    chart readability and calculates the overall survival rate.
6.  **Univariate analysis** --- plots the age distribution and passenger
    survival counts.
7.  **Bivariate analysis** --- compares survival rates by sex and
    passenger class.
8.  **Boxplot analysis** --- compares fare distributions by survival
    status.
9.  **Scatterplot analysis** --- explores age versus fare, coloured by
    survival status.
10. **Pairplot** --- compares selected numeric variables and survival
    groups.
11. **Correlation heatmap** --- visualizes correlations among selected
    numeric columns.
12. **Findings and conclusion** --- summarizes the patterns observed.

## Key findings recorded in the notebook

-   The dataset contains **891 passengers** and **12 original columns**.
-   The overall survival rate is approximately **38.4%**.
-   More passengers did not survive than survived.
-   Female passengers had a substantially higher survival rate than male
    passengers.
-   First-class passengers had a higher survival rate than second- and
    third-class passengers.
-   Fare values are right-skewed; survivors generally show a higher
    median fare.
-   Age and fare do not show a strong simple linear relationship in the
    scatterplot.
-   `Age` has 177 missing values, `Cabin` has 687 missing values, and
    `Embarked` has 2 missing values in the supplied CSV.
-   The notebook does not silently remove outliers or fill missing
    values.

These are descriptive observations from this dataset. They do not
establish causation.

## Expected outputs

When all notebook cells have run successfully, the notebook displays: -
Dataset preview, structure and descriptive statistics - Missing-value
and duplicate summaries - Frequency-count tables - Age histogram and
survival count plot - Survival-rate bar plots by sex and passenger
class - Fare boxplot - Age-versus-fare scatterplot - Pairplot -
Correlation heatmap - Written observations and conclusion

## Notes

-   Keep the CSV filename exactly as `titanic_dataset.csv`, unless you
    also change the filename in the notebook.
-   The notebook adds a derived `SurvivalStatus` column during analysis;
    the original CSV is not modified.
-   Missing values are reported but are not imputed in this exploratory
    analysis.
-   For predictive modelling, decide how to handle missing values and
    other preprocessing steps before training a model.
